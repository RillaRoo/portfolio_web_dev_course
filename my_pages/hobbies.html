<h2>The poetry of music</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of my free time immersing myself in the world of video games, exploring new genres and aspects of game creation, especially music. I use tools like FL Studio and new engines to broaden my knowledge.</p>
<p>Writing is another passion of mine, focusing on creative themes such as philosophy, psychology and crafting narratives for video games, particularly those that delve into the human mind.</p>
<p>Aside from music, I'm also a member of a tuna named Tuna de Santa Maria, a musical group where many experiences and a lot of knowledge are shared. It's a place where I can grow and maintain the philosophies that have shaped me.</p>
